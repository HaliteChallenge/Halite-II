The Halite Team has compiled a list of useful tools for you to check out. We haven't necessarily worked on them ourselves and don't maintain them, so they may not always be up-to-date, but we still think they could be very helpful to you! And if they came from the forums, we've also linked the associated forums page so you can reach out to the creator for feedback.

## Learning how to play
- Seven-part video tutorials on getting started through building an ML bot. See <https://pythonprogramming.net/search/?q=halite>
