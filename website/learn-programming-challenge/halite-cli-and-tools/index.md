### NOTE: The 2017-2018 season of Halite II has ended and submissions have closed. You can still create an account to be alerted when we launch the next season, and you can always play offline.

Some awesome toys and APIs for you to be super productive while playing Halite. You can see all game server code in the [Halite II open-source repo](https://github.com/HaliteChallenge/Halite-II). To play offline, you can also play against the top player bots that have been open-sourced. See our [community resources](/other-resources/community-resources)

* [Halite CI](cli): Halite executable that is responsible for running games.
* [Upload Bots Tool](halite-client-tools): Upload your bots from the terminal instead of the website.
* [Compare Bots Tools](halite-client-tools): Compare win/loss ration multiple versions of your bots.
* [Game Data Download Tool](game-data): Download games played on our servers.
